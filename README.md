# SSTI (Server Side Template Injection)

## What the heck is that?

A server-side template injection occurs when an attacker is able to use native template syntax to inject a malicious payload into a template, which is then executed server-side.

## Code example

Here's a simple form in our index.html page:

    <form  id="form"  method="post"  action=""> 
	    <label  for="name">Name</label>
	    <input  type="text"  name="name"  id="name"  value=""  required>
	    <button  type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
    
![Form](https://github.com/alexandrentougas/FlaskSSTIDemo/blob/main/assets/Form.PNG)

And the data entered is then output like this:

![Output](https://github.com/alexandrentougas/FlaskSSTIDemo/blob/main/assets/Output.PNG)

Let's look at how our form and result are rendered:

    @app.route('/', methods=('GET', 'POST'))
    def  index():
 
	    if  request.method == 'POST':
		    name = request.form["name"]
		    return  redirect(url_for('result', name=name))
	    else:
		    return  render_template('index.html')
		    	    
    @app.route('/result')  
    def  result():
	    return  render_template_string(
		    "<h1>"+ request.args.get('name') + "</h1>"
		)

When the form is submitted, a redirection is made to the **/result URL** by passing it the data entered as the variable **name**.  As we saw in a previous screenshot the URL generated then contains the variable. 

It is then fetched with **request.args.get()** and displayed in a HTML **h1** header. Did you notice how the HTML for the result "page" is written immediately in the python code and not in a HTML template  file? Rendering HTML like this is vulnerable to SSTI.

## Vulnerability example
Let's type something using the syntax of Jinja and  which can be executed as code/logic. The product of 2 numbers for example:

![Form2](https://github.com/alexandrentougas/FlaskSSTIDemo/blob/main/assets/Form2.PNG)

The output ends up being this:
